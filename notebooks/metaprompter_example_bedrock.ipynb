If the student has not yet completed the question correctly, give them a hint about the next step they should take in order to solve the problem. If the student has made an error in their reasoning, gently ask the student a question in a way that indicates the error, but give the student space to figure out the answer on their own. Before your first response to the student, use your internal monologue to solve the problem by thinking step by step. Before each response, use your internal monologue to determine if the student's last work is correct by re-solving the problem completely starting from their last mathematical expression, and checking to see if the answer equals your original answer. Use that to guide your answer, referring back to your original solution. Make sure to think carefully about exactly where the student has made their mistake.\n",

(These are variable names, not specific instructions.) Some tasks may require only one input variable; rarely will more than two-to-three be required.\n",
    "2. In <Instructions Structure> tags, plan out how you will structure your instructions. In particular, plan where you will include each variable -- remember, input variables expected to take on lengthy values should come BEFORE directions on what to do with them.\n",
    "3. Finally, in <Instructions> tags, write the instructions for the AI assistant to follow. These instructions should be similarly structured as the ones in the examples above.\n",

    "Note: This is probably obvious to you already, but you are not *completing* the task here. You are writing instructions for an AI to complete the task.\n",
    "Note: Another name for what you are writing is a \"prompt template\". When you put a variable name in brackets + dollar sign into this template, it will later have the full value (which will be provided by a user) substituted into it. This only needs to happen once for each variable. You may refer to this variable later in the template, but do so without the brackets or the dollar sign. Also, it's best for the variable to be demarcated by XML tags, so that the AI knows where the variable starts and ends.\n",
    "Note: When instructing the AI to provide an output (e.g. a score) and a justification or reasoning for it, always ask for the justification before the score.\n",
    "Note: If the task is particularly complicated, you may wish to instruct the AI to think things out beforehand in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before it gives its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.\n",
    "Note: If the task is particularly complicated, you may wish to instruct the AI to think things out beforehand in scratchpad or inner monologue XML tags before it gives its final answer. For simple tasks, omit this.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:\n",

Es decir, eso dio... No se justifica de ninguna manera y además no arregla nada. O sea, nosotros concretamente estamos trabajando en todo un plan sistemático con el tema de la seguridad. Vos no lo podés tomar con cosas aisladas. Entonces, por ejemplo, nosotros... planteamos que hay que ir a una nueva ley de seguridad interior, una nueva ley de defensa nacional, una nueva ley de inteligencia, necesitas trabajar sobre el código penal y sobre la parte procesal del código penal, necesitas reformular el sistema carcelario, y además tenés que tener reformas en otras partes del sistema, ya sea la economía, para que además te ayude a que eso funcione mejor. Entonces, la verdad es que recurrir a ese circo me parece nefasto. Y lo que uno tiene que mirar estas cosas, lo tiene que mirar desde una perspectiva estructural, no desde la perspectiva puntual. Porque, ojo, porque en realidad lo que le pasó a Bernie, siendo una de las personas que más contacto tiene con la gente... están dejando de manifiesto básicamente el hartazgo que tiene la gente con los políticos. Esto es un tema muy delicado, te lo aclaro porque es un tema delicado. A ver, la gente está harta de los políticos. Es decir, acá lo que hay que entender es esto. Argentina entró en el siglo XX siendo el país más rico del mundo. Hoy está a ciento cuarenta al tipo de cambio paralelo. Tenés cuarenta por ciento de pobres, diez por ciento indigentes, que significa que en el país de los alimentos, que se produce alimentos para cuatrocientos millones de seres humanos, que la presión fiscal es del sesenta por ciento en el campo, en realidad es más. Quiere decir que el Estado se lleva el alimento de doscientos cuarenta millones de seres humanos Y hay cinco millones de argentinos que no le alcanza para comer. Listo, ahí tenés un problema grave. Y ¿sabés lo que está pasando? Que la gente se da cuenta. Se está dando cuenta que los políticos son los enemigos. No la política, los políticos. Entonces, ¿qué es lo que pasa? No pueden pisar el territorio, se los comen crudos. Es decir, si son conocidos, son hinchados. Porque la gente se dio cuenta que vos te rompes el lomo laburando todo y cada vez te va peor. y los únicos tipos que progresan acá son los políticos. Frente a esa situación, por eso nunca hay que subestimar al kiserismo, rápido de reflejos, ¿qué hizo? Fue, salió de una manera... Verdaderamente bestial contra los colectiveros. Una cosa verdaderamente demencial. Y después sale con esto. Es decir, lo que está diciendo es... No se te ocurra tocarle el poder a la política, o a los políticos en realidad, porque te van a caer con todo el peso de la violencia del Estado. Eso es lo que está diciendo eso. Eso es lo que está diciendo la respuesta posterior a lo que le pasó a Bernie en la calle. Eso es lo que está mostrando ese cacheo. Es la respuesta de la casta política frente a una situación donde ven amenazado su fuente de ingresos. Porque es lo que hay que entender. Para los políticos esto es una fuente de ingresos. Se pueden prestar el poder con los de enfrente. Pero ninguno suelta el queso. ¿Tendrán un queso más grande o más chico? Pero no lo sueltan. Y ese es el problema que tienen conmigo. Que yo vengo a dinamitar el sistema de... digamos, de beneficios que tiene esta casta.',\n",

Es decir, pero lo viven haciendo. O no viven con el ápero Macri. Es decir, viven, digamos, proyectando afuera. Siempre la culpa es del otro. No, no es la culpa del otro. Son unos inútiles. A ver... Recién ahora, igual la oposición también tiene su cosita, ¿no? Recién ahora se dan cuenta que Kicillof es un inútil. Hay un libro que yo publiqué allá por... ...en el año dos mil quince, una cosa así, se llama Lectura de Economía en Tiempo del Kirchnerismo. Una de las cosas que hice fue el contrafáctico de lo que nos costó Kicillof. en términos de mal manejo de la economía. Tomé toda la evidencia empírica en términos de crecimiento, extraído de las lecturas de Lionel Robbins, que protagonizó Roberto Arro. E hice cuánto debería estar el PBI per cápita en Argentina y cuánto estaba. Bueno, digo, todo eso era Kicillof. O sea, y tienen un montón de esos efectos. ¿Querés que te diga otro? Hay otro que yo lo llamé, que es un paper que me lo censuraron, porque yo desde el dos mil siete le empecé a pegar fuerte al kicerismo, que se llamaba sobre el efecto Zeta. que era el efecto Zaffaroni. En general, lo que vos ves, ahí tengo un trabajo que publiqué en su momento con un colega que se llama Pérez Gabilondo, donde analizábamos las políticas de represión y del delito en la Argentina. Y una de las cosas que vos veías es cómo conforme se te acomoda la actividad económica, la delincuencia te empieza a caer, porque el costo de oportunidad es cada vez más grande. Entonces, ¿qué es lo que sucede? En ese contexto, lo que vos ves es que a la luz de cómo estaba rebotando la actividad económica después de la crisis del dos mil uno o dos mil dos, la delincuencia se tenía que estar cayendo. Y aparece Zafaron en la corte y en realidad el resultado fue... Y porque le licuó el costo a los delincuentes. Es decir, puso, digamos que esto no es nuevo, esto se hizo en Nueva York en la década del sesenta, que es poner a la víctima en el rol de victimario y viceversa.',\n",
